                <h3>Who invented the M&M candies?</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>M&M’s were created by Forrest Mars Sr., the son of Mars Company founder Frank C. Mars, in 1941. He developed the idea after seeing soldiers in the Spanish Civil War eating chocolate coated with a hard sugar shell to prevent melting. Mars partnered with Bruce Murrie, the son of Hershey’s president, to secure a steady supply of chocolate, which is why the candy was named M&M’s (Mars & Murrie). Initially, M&M’s were sold exclusively to the U.S. military during World War II before becoming widely available to the public.</p>
